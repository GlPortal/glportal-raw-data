## Score Specification
Be able to provide a a basic outside of the different sections of score.
Supply a working document in your folder for each piece with the following information: Piece/File title, key, tempo, time signature. For example: see (Benji's example - I will create this. It could be a good way to have a quick reference for what piece fits where)

## Track Specification for Implementation 
Work with implementation in mind. The track will ultimately want to be split up into different components to adapt to the gameplay environment. For example, percussion, melody, and instrument types are commonly separated components. 

## Score creation
Create your track by whatever means works best for you and produced the best quality. When you are finished normalize the volume at 90% peak (~ -1 dB peak) and export as an OGG Vorbis file (*.ogg)

## Re-Iteration
Present the results to glPortal team and be willing to respond to feedback.

# Additional Information
Depending on what levels will be created, different ambiences will be used, calm or... less calm.
Each level will have colored tiles setting the mood, and blinking according to what's being played as background music.

## Recommended Tools
You may use whatever tools you are used to work with, but if possible use free and open source music composing applications such as Lilypond if you don't find yourself limited by them.

## Submitting Your Materials
Gather all the following and send it
* directly using `git` to the [glportal_raw_data](https://github.com/GlPortal/glportal_raw_data) repository (preferred)
* or to one of the team members who will put it on the repo for you.

### Visual Tracks
It is possible that we need track data in MIDI format. Don't bother with advanced settings or even assigning instruments to each track, this MIDI file is merely used for the creation of musical visual feedback.

### License
You are free to chose the license for the files you created, as long as you allow the music to be redistributed along with GlPortal. This is the minimum requirement.
Also bear in mind people may want to use your works for other projects or want to remix it. Ideally choose a [Creative Commons license](http://creativecommons.org/choose/) like CC BY-SA (Attribution, Share Alike) which is a [Free Culture](http://creativecommons.org/freeworks) one, to allow this.}
